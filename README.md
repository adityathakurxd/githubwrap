# GitHub Unwrapped
Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Recently, I made a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityathakurxd/detail/recent-activity/shares/) on LinkedIn about how Spotify has #SpotifyWrapped Snapchat has #Lookback. But, there isn't anything similar for GitHub!

That's exactly why [Ishan Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishandeveloper/) made #GithubWrapped, to take a look back at all the contributions we made in these unprecedented times.

## What is GitHub Unwrapped?
This repository is an attempt to create something similar but with Flutter Web using the GitHub API. ðŸ¤­

I have so far been able to create a HomePage that takes in the username from user and passes it to Result.dart which makes a call using GitHubApi.dart.

There are certain issues I am working with, which once fixed I'll deploy it on Firebase.

The screenshots are attached below:
